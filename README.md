# Random ID Generator - in Electron
This project is just a simple and not-so-user-friendly ID Generator that I made in Electron, for learn purpose.<br/>
Please, don't complain 'bout filenames(yeah, ik that "IDGenerator.html" and "main_electron.js" aren't good names).<br/>
Also, I just made this to understand a bit how Electron works, so this isn't anything so complex or useful, but only my own way to learn Electron.<br/>
I made this app a long time ago(~March 2018) but I found it useful when I needed to easily generate random IDs when being offline, so I created this repo to make it public(if it helps me, it can help others).<br/>
Nowadays I really like Electron(even if RAM-wasteful) and I know it a lot better.<br/>
